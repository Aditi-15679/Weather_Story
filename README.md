# WeatherStory 🌦

Hi! I’m Aditi, and this is *WeatherStory* — a small journaling tool I created for myself to reflect on my mood every day. It combines how I feel with a randomly chosen weather, and gives me something poetic and comforting to read — kind of like turning emotions into little stories.

---

## 🧠 Why I Made This

Some days are bright, some are cloudy — outside and inside. I just wanted a space to track that, without pressure. This started as a coding experiment, but became something more emotional and personal over time. It helped me stay consistent, reflect, and sometimes even smile.

## 🌤 What It Does

- Asks how you're feeling (mood check-in)
- Simulates a weather for the day
- Shows a calming reflection and a poem line based on your mood
- Adds a fun ASCII weather art
- Keeps a mood streak if you check in daily
- Lets you guess the weather (just for fun!)
- Gives you an optional prompt to journal your thoughts
- Saves everything so you can look back later
- Sometimes shows a surprise hidden message :)

## 🌱 Final Thoughts

I know it’s just a CLI tool, but it means something to me. It’s honest, simple, emotional, and maybe even useful for others who like to reflect. I wanted this project to feel like a calm little corner of the day — and that’s what it became.

Thanks for reading 💛  
— Aditi
